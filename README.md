//////////The Problem Statement/////////////
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 (T20) cricket championships that was started in 2008 in India. It was initiated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with eight franchises comprising players from across the world. The first IPL auction was held in 2008 for ownership of the teams for 10 years, with a base price of USD 50 million. The franchises acquire players through an English auction that is conducted every year. However, there are several rules imposed by the IPL. For example, there is a maximum cap on the money a franchise can spend on buying players.
The performance of the players could be measured through several metrics. Although the IPL follows the Twenty20 format of the game, it is possible that the performance of the players in the other formats of the game such as Test and One-Day matches can influence player pricing. A few players have excellent records in Test matches, but their records in Twenty20 matches are not very impressive. The dataset consists of the performance of 130 players measured through various performance metrics such as batting strike rate, economy rate and so on in the year 2013.
